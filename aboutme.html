        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="assets/img/aboutme.jpg" alt="About Me" class="img">

            My name is Bentley Redden. I am college student from Provo, Utah studying Information Systems. 
            I love traveling, hikikng, climbing, skiing, and pretty much anything outdoors. I have created this page to share my love for mountaineering and the outdoors. 
            I don't have a ton of mountaineering experience, but I am eager to learn more before my next adventure. I am planning on summitting Mount Rainier in Washington in May and could not be more excited.
            I am also planning on hiking through Peru up to Machu Picchu in late June with my family. This is only just the beginning though. Soon I hope to be able to tackle more challenging climbs like Mount Denali in Alaska or Mount Kiliminjaro in Africa.
            I am really excited to see what I can accomplish in the near future with this new found love for mountaineering.
